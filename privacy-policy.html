                at any time by contacting Sol Ecom Inc. However, we may not
                accommodate a request to change information if we believe the

                the contact details provided under the "Contact Details" section

                the lawfulness of any data processing, which Sol Ecom Inc has
                conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect
                processing of your personal information, which has been
                conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
                consent. If you wish to raise a complaint about how we have
                handled your Personal data, you can contact us through the web

                the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This

                data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive
                it. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data
                (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, Sol Ecom Inc
                may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to comply with your
                request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or
                excessive.

                Sol Ecom Inc tries to respond to all legitimate requests within

              </p>
              <p>
                We store your Personal Data for as long as needed to provide you
                with our Service. We may store Data longer, but only in a way
                that it cannot be tracked back to you. When Personal Data is no
                longer needed, we delete it using reasonable measures to protect
                the Data from unauthorized access or use.<br /><br /><strong
                  >EU Territory.&nbsp;</strong
                >We store Personal Data as long as it is needed for the
                provision of our Service. Traffic information is erased or made
                anonymous when it is no longer needed for the transmission or,
                in the case of payable Service, up to the end of the period
                during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payment
                pursued. Direct marketing and provision of value-added Service
                information (including traffic information used for these
                purposes) are stored as long as the same is necessary for the
                provision of these activities, or up to the time when a User
                opts out from such use under this Privacy Policy. Other
                information is stored for as long as we consider it to be
                necessary for the provision of our Service. This Section shall
                not prevent any technical storage or access to information for
                the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a
                communication or as strictly necessary for us to provide the
                Service you requested.<br /><br />As explained in the GDPR
                statement, We strive to anonymize the data when possible. If you
                decide to exercise your right to erasure, We will also inform
                our providers to delete all your data.<br /><br /><strong
                  >US Territory.</strong
                >&nbsp;We will retain collected information for the period
                necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
                Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted
                by applicable legislation.<br />Storing might be different
                depending on the territory of collecting the information and the
                applicable legislation, but We always strive to store the
                information only as long as it is needed to provide, improve, or
                personalize our Service.

                misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We
                have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
                personal information from being accidentally lost, used, or
                accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. For
                example, we store your Personal Data on secure servers
                accessible only to exceptional individuals. We are trying to
                prevent access by any unauthorized parties by encrypting this
                information. We have put procedures to deal with any suspected
                data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable
                regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to
                do so.<br /><br />For all other information above our control,
                visitors and users should consider this communication and
                information to be non-confidential, and consequently, we assume
                no responsibility or liability if any information relating to
                any visitor or subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an
                unintended recipient.<br /><br />We may grant access to your
                personal data to our contractors or employees, in particular in
                sales support, with the guarantee that they comply with the
                necessary level of protection of your personal data against
                unauthorized access, loss, manipulation, falsification, and
                destruction, or unauthorized disclosure. This is done through
                appropriate administrative, technical, and physical measures on
                our part<br /><br />There is no 100% secure method of
                transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage.
                Therefore, We cannot guarantee it’s absolute security.<br /><br />We
                never process any kind of sensitive data or criminal offense
                data. Also, we never undertake to profile personal data.

                <strong>XIII. INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not intentionally collect or maintain information from
                persons under the age of 13, however, according to each country
                and its laws, the processing of the personal data of a child
                will be lawful where the child is at another age.<br /><br />If
                we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we
                will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without
                the parent/guardian’s consent. If we become aware that we have
                unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a
                child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to
                delete such information from our records.<br /><br />We also
                recommend that parents monitor their children’s Internet
                activities and learn and employ software or other tools that can
                help their children enjoy their online experience without
                compromising their personal safety or allowing them to use the
                Internet in a manner inconsistent with their parent/guardian’s
                preferences.
